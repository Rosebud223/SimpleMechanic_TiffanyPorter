Unlike its predecessor CollabProxy,\nthis package has completely switched the UI to using UIElements. There is no more CEF, JS, or HTML.\n\nThe project is exclusively targeting .NetStandard 2.0 and will not work with the legacy Mono runtime.\n\nThe minimum supported version of the Unity Editor is 2020.1a13.\n\n## Development\n**For developers:**\n\nOption 1: clone this repository out into the `packages/` directory in a project.\n\nOption 2: clone elsewhere and link with the `packages/manifest.json` file in the project:\n```\n\"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"file:/some/path/to/package\"\n```\nTo add testing support also add the testibles section to the manifest. Your manifest should look like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"file:/some/path/to/package\",\n    ...\n  },\n  \"testables\": [\n    \"com.unity.collab-proxy\",\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**For internal testers:** simply add the git url into the `packages/manifest.json` file:\n```\n\"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git\"\n```\nIf you need a specific revisision:\n```\n\"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git#<rev>\"\n```\nIf you need more information, read the [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-dependencies.html#Git) for package dependencies from git.\n\nCode style is as dictated in [Unity Meta](https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/unity-meta).\n\nThere are IDE Specific code style configs under the `Config/` directory in the above repo.\n\n## Overview\nSource code for the packages is contained within the `Editor/`\nand the tests are in `Tests/`. The structure of the package follows\nthe **MVP** pattern with a separate directory for each group of classes\nand interfaces.\n\nHere are some files and folders of note:\n```none\n<root>\n  ├── package.json\n  ├── README.md\n  ├── CHANGELOG.md\n  ├── LICENSE.md\n  ├── Third Party Notices.md\n  ├── QAReport.md\n  ├── Editor/\n  │   └── Collaborate\n  │       ├── Unity.CollabProxy.Editor.asmdef\n  │       ├── Assets/\n  │       │   ├── Icons/\n  │       │   ├── Layouts/\n  │       │   ├── Styles/\n  │       │   └── UiConstants.cs\n  │       ├── Models/\n  │       │   ├── Api/\n  │       │   │   └── ISourceControlProvider.cs\n  │       │   └── Providers/\n  │       │       └── Collab.cs\n  │       ├── Views/\n  │       ├── Presenters/\n  │       ├── Common/\n  │       ├── Settings/\n  │       ├── Components/\n  │       ├── Utilities/\n  │       └── UserInterface/\n  │           ├── Bootstrap.cs\n  │           ├── WindowCache.cs\n  │           ├── ToolbarButton.cs\n  │           └── CollaborateWindow.cs\n  ├── Tests/\n  │   ├── Collaborate\n  │   │   └── Editor/\n  │   │       └── Unity.CollabProxy.EditorTests.asmdef\n  │   └── .tests.json\n  └── Documentation~/\n       ├── unity-cloud-collaborate.md\n       └── Images/\n```\n\n- `Editor/Assets/` directory of the collaborate assets.\n- `Editor/Assets/Icons/` directory for the collection of icons (png) used in the UI.\n- `Editor/Assets/Layouts/` directory for the collection of layouts (uxml) used in the UI.\n- `Editor/Assets/Styles/` directory for the collection of styles (uss) used in the UI.\n- `Editor/Models/` directory of the models in the MVP architecture.\n- `Editor/Models/Api/ISourceControlProvider.cs` interface for source control providers.

Workaround is to install and select a supported diff tool in the Preferences->External Tools window.\n* [COL-1084] Triggering a domain reload while Collab History tab is open disables the UX until the Editor is focused. Workaround is to click onto the Editor a second time.\n* [COL-1085] Go Back To commit in 2020.1 with pre-v1.2.17 in package manifest breaks Collaborate window. Workaround is to open project in a version of Unity older than 2020.1.0a13 where pre-v1.2.17 packages are supported.\n","_resolved":"","_integrity":"","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git","type":"git","revision":"51447944a1e7d94937e6b7f9e887d58f5097ed13"},"_npmVersion":"6.13.4","_nodeVersion":"12.16.1","unityRelease":"14f1","readmeFilename":"README.md","name":"com.unity.collab-proxy","version":"1.9.0","displayName":"Version Control","description":"The Version Control package gives you the ability to use either Collaborate or Plastic SCM for Unity (beta) in the Unity editor.

Your manifest should look like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"file:/some/path/to/package\",\n    ...\n  },\n  \"testables\": [\n    \"com.unity.collab-proxy\",\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOnce you have fetched the package, run `msbuild` on the `.ServerSource/Source/` directory to ensure the proxy sever is created.\n\n**For internal testers:**\n\nSimply add the git url into the `packages/manifest.json` file:\n```\n\"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git\"\n```\nIf you need a specific revisision:\n```\n\"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git#<rev>\"\n```\nOnce you have fetched the package, run `msbuild` on the `.ServerSource/Source/` directory to ensure the proxy sever is created.\n\nIf you need more information, read the [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-dependencies.html#Git) for package dependencies from git.\n\nCode style is as dictated in [Unity Meta](https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/unity-meta).\n\nThere are IDE Specific code style configs under the `Config/` directory in the above repo.\n\n## Overview\nSource code for the packages is contained within the `Editor/`\nand the tests are in `Tests/`.
